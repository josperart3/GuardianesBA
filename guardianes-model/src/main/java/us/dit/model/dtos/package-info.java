/**
 * This packed will contain the DTO classes (Data Transfer Objects) used to
 * serialize the entities of the model.
 * <p>
 * These are the currently existing DTOs:
 * <p>
 * Public DTOs: These DTOs will represent the REST interface. Example
 * DoctorPublicDTO
 * <p>
 * Scheduler DTOs: These DTOs will represent the interface provided to the
 * scheduler
 * <p>
 * Using the DTO pattern allows changing the fields and methods of the model
 * entities without worrying about exposing undesired data through the different
 * interfaces
